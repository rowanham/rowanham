### Projects


I just started this, so this list will be incomplete.


* The [RoScope]() - This is my current hobby/project. It's an oscilloscope made from a little ARM board. (A SparkFun Artemis board, which has an Ambiq Apollo3 SOC.)
  + [embedded](https://github.com/rowanham/RoScopeTarget) - This is the embedded code - just straight C code, thought it does use the [Ambiq Suite SDK]() and the Jasmine ([jsmn]()) package for lightweight JSON parsing.
  + [host](https://github.com/rowanham/RoScopeHost) - This is the host code - it is all Python, and like most Python uses a bazillion packages. (`pyserial`, `numpy`, `pysimplegui`, etc.)


* Documentation - all jupyter notebooks. (I like them because they format nicely, they easily include figures, and they support (a subset of) LaTex.) They are all on [bitbucket](), so I will make them available when I have time. (Except for the work logbooks, those will have to wait until I am dead.)
    + On the RoScope:
        * The Host
        * The Target
        * Associated Hardware
    + Math & Physics:
        * Manifolds, etc.
    + Logbooks:
        * Foretellai
        * iCoin
        * One Drop
